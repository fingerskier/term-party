# Scratchpad
* A sub-directory that terminal sub-processes can read/write
* Instantiate a ChromaDB (vector database) in that directory
* Watch file changes in that directory and update the ChromaDB accordingly
* Provide an MPC and SDK for terminal sub-processes and agents to query the ChromaDB
* Provide a "Scratchpad" view (like terminals) to query the ChromaDB and display results in a user-friendly way
* "Send To" an open terminal ~ _paste_ that file to the terminal

# Favorites
* Instead of a modal popup make the favorites view like the terminals


# Dashboard
* Non-terminal view
* Show when clicking "TERM-PARTY" in the top left
* Tails all open terminals
* CPU and memory usage
* Exit codes for recently closed terminals
